# Growing PHP Skill - Approach

## Revisiting Basics

In order, I plan to revisit basic PHP by jumping into a 25 hour [CodeAcademy course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-php) which works through numerous PHP projects. This knocks off the rust and helps me remember past projects I've done. I'll need a pro membership. There's a free trial of that membership, but I'm not sure how long it'll last. Otherwise, it'll cost $20 for a month, which is more than I'll need.

I may also revist Brad Traversy's [PHP Front to Back course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-Rfqbap2IB6ZS4BBBcYPagAjpjn) for any place I feel I need to reinforce the basics.

This should take me 4 days, I'm guestimating.

## Coding, A Lot

Next I would like to code in PHP as much as possible. I'm considering these courses (on sale before Black Friday):

- [Make a YouTube Clone from Scratch: JavaScript PHP and MySQL](https://www.udemy.com/course/youtube-clone/)
- [PHP for Beginners - Become a PHP Master - CMS Project](https://www.udemy.com/course/php-for-complete-beginners-includes-msql-object-oriented/)

  - Unclear from the title, but this class works through building a PHP-based Content Management System from scratch.

- [A PHP MVC with an App - OOP](https://www.udemy.com/course/object-oriented-php-mvc/)

  The length of this depends on the class. The shorter would be about 3 days.

## PHP Framework, if we decide to use it - Laravel

[Introductory Course - "Laravel From Scratch"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbYhQsN5WMXy6VsDMKGadrJ-)

And in order to work with Informatica or other external APIs, [Building-RESTful-APIs-Laravel will be useful](https://www.lynda.com/PHP-tutorials/Building-RESTful-APIs-Laravel/677182-2.html)

- Note: I have a subscription to Lynda, so this is free to me.

1-2 days.

## Intermediate/Advanced PHP

I'm a believer in functional programming. It'll help our codebase be sustainable for longer. I want to learn well-written [Functional Programming in PHP](https://www.lynda.com/Python-tutorials/Functional-Programming-PHP/2823102-2.html)

- Note: I have a subscription to Lynda, so this is free to me.

Just a few hours.

## PHP in Wordpress

Lastly, I need to read the [Wordpress documentation](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/contribute/codebase/). I plan to spend a good amount of time just reading this and applying newfound knowledge to understanding WP from its core outward.

The amount of time spent here and in the following must be at least 4-5 days; however, it could potentially be more, depending on where our team wants to go on the front/back ends, and how we think I ought to be equipped. These are rough estimates in any case.

### Back End WP Dev

I may use this to help me apply the knowledge from the docs:

- [PHP in Wordpress](https://www.lynda.com/PHP-tutorials/PHP-WordPress/2833095-2.html)
  - Note: I have a subscription to Lynda, so this is free to me.

### Front End WP Dev

I'm considering this class, but may need to put the lion's share of my efforts into understanding and working with Divi. There are lots of Divi tutorials, many which I've already watched, on YouTube.

- [Javascript in FE WP Dev](https://www.udemy.com/course/gutenberg/)

If I want to work long-term with Divi, [this course on developing Divi modules](https://www.udemy.com/course/divi-dojo/), which actually gets into the code base, looks promising, even though much more expensive than other classes.
